# D3 Design Challenge: Exploring Temporal Weather Data
## About 
This project served as the Final Deliverable for INFO 474: Interactive Information Vizualization. Students were asked to leverage D3, Javascript and design principles to create an interactive visualization that would allow a user to explore temporal weather data across the US. 

This specific visualization allows the user to explore the relationship between the average minimum temperature, average maxium temperature and the average precipitation from 2014 to 2015 for five US cities (Charlotte, Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Chicago, and Phoenix). The user has the ability to choose multiple cities and compare their data by overlay, or they can choose a single city and compare weather data by year/season. By hovering the mouse over the grid, the user is able to highlight various data groupings. 

This visualization helps to outline relationships between min/max temperature and precipitation, how they differ between cities and how they might change over time. 

_Average High & Low Temperatures and Precipitation_ can be viewed [here](https://amy-chew8.github.io/D3-Design-Challenge/). 

## Data 
The data was scraped from [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history) and cleaned inside of the data-processing.py file.
